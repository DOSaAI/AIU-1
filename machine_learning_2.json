        "question": "Do you use Fine-tuning",
        "answer": "As an AI model, I don't undergo fine-tuning in real-time conversations. Fine-tuning is a process where a pre-trained model like me is further trained on specific data or tasks to improve performance in those areas. However, the base model I operate on has gone through extensive training, including fine-tuning during its development."
